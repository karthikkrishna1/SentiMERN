# SentiX
## In Progress

A single platform for everything related to sentiment analysis. Users can add text, links to news articles (scraping) or human face images to detect sentiment and emotion.

Currently Employed:
-  A sentiment analysis model built using a RNN architecture in Tensorflow and preprocessing done on NLTK. 
-  Deployed using Flask and used in a web application built using React and Node.js.
-  Scraped news articles from their links using cheerio and analysed the sentiment of their content

Planned Features:
-  Analysis in other languages as well ( current idea: using google translate API to convert text to english and analyse)
-  Detecting face emotion through image
-  Getting text from image (OCR) and analysing
-  and more....
